# Campaign Impact Analysis

The bank is currently struggling with low engagement from its marketing campaigns, even though they possess extensive customer data. Given this situation, the bank requires a marketing strategy that focuses on awareness campaigns: introducing the brand and products to as many new audiences as possible. Through analysis, we will derive actionable insights on how the existing marketing strategies can be improved.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To evaluate the success of our marketing campaigns, we focus on the following KPIs:

1. **Reach**: Measures the number of unique customers exposed to the campaign.
   - **Business Outcome**: Higher reach increases brand awareness and market share.

2. **Engagement Rate**: Percentage of engagement attempts resulting in successful interactions.
   - **Business Outcome**: Higher engagement rates strengthen customer relationships and retention.

3. **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of engaged customers who take the desired action.
   - **Business Outcome**: Higher conversion rates drive revenue and profitability.

4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Total worth of a customer over their relationship with the bank.
   - **Business Outcome**: Targeting high-CLV customers boosts long-term profitability.
