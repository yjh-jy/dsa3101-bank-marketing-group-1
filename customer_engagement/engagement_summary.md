# Detailed Engagement Analysis Report

This report summarizes findings from separate exploratory analyses at the campaign and customer levels, based on the use of `campaign_engagement.ipynb` and `customer_engagement.ipynb`. The goal is to identify which variables are most associated with user engagement in the bankâ€™s marketing efforts.

---
## 1. Campaign-Level Analysis

This section uses `campaign_engagement.ipynb`, which performs aggregation at the `campaign_id` level. The key engagement variable is `engagement_rate`, which is derived from dividing `num_engaged` by `num_targeted`.

### A. Derived Metrics

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `engagement_rate` | Proportion of targeted users who engaged |
| `click_through_rate` | Clicks divided by impressions |
| `impressions_per_day` | Mean impressions normalized by campaign duration |
| `targets_per_day` | Number of targets per day |
| `clicks_per_day` | Number of clicks per day |

### B. Barplots (Categorical Features by Engagement Rate)

| Feature | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| **channel_used** | Channels like Google Ads and Instagram are associated with higher engagement rates. |
| **campaign_type** | Display Advertising shows stronger performance than other types. |
| **campaign_language** | Slight variation observed across languages; French and English appear to yield better engagement in some cases. |
| **target_audience** | Engagement varies by audience; certain age segments show higher responsiveness. |
| **quarter** | Seasonal effects are visible; some quarters show better engagement outcomes. |

### C. Boxplots (Continuous Features by Engagement Rate)

| Feature | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| **clicks** | Higher click averages are associated with higher engagement rates. |
| **impressions** | Campaigns with more impressions tend to perform better, though effect may be nonlinear. |
| **campaign_duration** | Medium-length campaigns show higher engagement; very long campaigns drop off. |
| **click_through_rate** | Strongly differentiates campaigns; higher CTR correlates with high engagement. |
| **clicks_per_day** | Daily click volume is an effective signal of engagement success. |
| **impressions_per_day** | Effective for evaluating campaign pacing; higher values generally support engagement. |
| **targets_per_day** | Moderate signal; reflects campaign intensity. |

### D. Violin Plots (Continuous Features by Engagement Bin)

The violin plots visualize how the distribution of key campaign metrics varies across low, medium, and high engagement tiers.

| Feature               | Insight |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **clicks**            | Distributions for high engagement campaigns show higher median and upper range of click counts. |
| **impressions**       | Higher impression volumes are associated with higher engagement, with some spread across tiers. |
| **click_through_rate**| Higher CTR values are clearly linked to higher engagement tiers. |
| **clicks_per_day**    | High engagement campaigns sustain stronger daily click performance. |
| **impressions_per_day** | Campaigns with higher daily impression rates often yield better engagement. |
| **targets_per_day**   | Targeting intensity has a modest but visible impact on engagement outcomes. |
| **campaign_duration** | Very long campaigns trend toward lower engagement; short to medium durations perform better. |

### E. Correlation Matrix

Pairwise Pearson correlations among continuous campaign metrics are shown.

- `clicks`, `clicks_per_day`, and `click_through_rate` are strongly correlated with `engagement_rate`.
- `campaign_duration` and `target_per_day` has a weak negative correlation with most metrics, including `engagement_rate`.
- `impressions` and `impressions_per_day` are weakly positively associated with engagement.

### F. Chi-Square Tests (Categorical Features vs Engagement Bin)

| Feature           | P-Value | Interpretation |
|------------------|---------|----------------|
| **channel_used**     | < 0.001 | Strongly associated with engagement level |
| **campaign_type**    | < 0.001 | Strongly associated with engagement level |
| campaign_language | 0.20    | No significant association |
| target_audience   | 0.29    | No significant association |
| quarter           | 0.62    | No significant association |

## 3. Actionable Insights for Stakeholders

### A. Campaign Optimization
- Platforms like Google Ads or Instagram drive significantly more engagement. Consider allocating more budget and attention to these high-performing channels over lower-performing channels like email or telemarketing.
- Display advertising outperform others in driving engagement, as supported by both barplot and chi-square analyses.
- Short to medium-length campaigns perform better. Very long campaigns trend toward lower engagement, as shown in both boxplots and violin plots.
- CTR is one of the strongest differentiators of engagement. Design creatives and call-to-actions that improve CTR.
- `targets_per_day` shows only modest positive association, and excessive daily reach may not yield proportional returns.

### B. Targeting Strategy
- **Digital Activity**:
  - Engaged customers tend to have more recent web use, more mobile/web logins, and slightly higher `avg_web_time`.
  - Having the app, however, does not strongly correlate with engagement; usage patterns are more important than access.
  - High click and impression counts are strong indicators of potential engagement.
- **Demographics**:
  - Age, job type, and marital status show moderate to weak influence but may still support segmentation.
  - Unemployed individuals, students and singles show the highest engagement rates. Tailor messaging and offers for these groups.
  - Customers with primary education levels engage more frequently than those with tertiary education. Avoid over-segmenting based on assumed affluence.
  - Customers without dependents engage more, possibly due to more flexible financial or lifestyle priorities.
  - Counterintuitively, those with prior defaults show higher engagement. As such, these users may be more receptive to new offers.
  - Features like `has_home_loan`, `has_credit_card`, and `has_insurance` offer limited predictive power individually but could help in profiling.
  - Ownership of fixed deposits, personal loans, and investment products correlate positively with engagement. These customers may be more attentive to financial communication and offers.

## 4. Suggestions for Modeling

| Task | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Feature Selection** | Include campaign-level metrics like `clicks`, `click_through_rate`, `clicks_per_day`, `channel_used`, `campaign_type`. On the customer side, include `job`, `education`, and digital activity indicators (`days_since_web_use`, `avg_web_time`). |
| **Preprocessing** | One-hot encode categorical variables such as `channel_used`, `campaign_type`, `job`, `education`, `marital`. |
| **Remove Low-impact Features** | Consider removing `has_insurance`, `has_home_loan`, and `has_credit_card` if they degrade model performance. |
