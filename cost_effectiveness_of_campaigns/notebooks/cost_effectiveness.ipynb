    "The personalisation scores for each campaign reflect how tailored and relevant a campaign is for a given target audience. A higher personalisation score means that the campaign is better suited for specific audience segments, offering more customised content and messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Score calculation:\n",
    "- **Campaign type weights**: Different campaign types are assigned different weights based on their level of personalisation. For example, email marketing receives the highest weight as it often involves more tailored content for individual recipients. Display advertising receives the lowest weight as it is typically more generic.\n",
    "- **Language score**: Campaigns targeting customers who speak languages such as Mandarin are assigned a higher language score. More common languages such as English receive a lower score.\n",
    "- **Target audience score**: Different age groups are considered based on the presumed relevance of the campaign to that demographic. The age group of 35-44 receives the highest score as this group is typically highly engaged with personalised marketing content. They are often in a position where they are familiar with technology and digital campaigns, they are generally in a financially stable phase of life and are at the peak of their spending power and they are more likely to build loyalty to brands.\n",
    "- **Campaign duration score**: Longer campaigns are often more engaging and personalised, as they allow for sustained interactions.\n",

    "## Balancing of personalisation with cost-effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "The computed scores in this notebook – campaign personalisation scores, campaign engagement scores, campaign cost-benefit ratios and customer personalisation – provide a framework for optimising marketing strategies by aligning camapigns with customers' profiles whilst maintaining cost-effectiveness. These scores can be leveraged to effectively match campaigns with customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important assumption here is that higher personalisation scores increase costs, but also increase effectiveness, hence it is important to balance personalisation across different aspects of campaigns to maximise the Cost-Benefit ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few possible strategies are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Balancing high-personalisation with low-cost campaigns**:\n",
    "  - Email marketing and affiliate marketing can be highly personalised at a lower cost, compared to other channels like display advertising, which may require more resources for customisation. Focus on these more cost-effective channels whilst still maintaining a high personalisation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target high-potential segments with moderate personalisations**:\n",
    "  - Instead of personalising all aspects of a campaign, target customers with high personalisation potential with moderately personalised campaigns. For example, using dynamic email content based on purchase history can be highly effective but not as resource-intensive as fully individualised product recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use tiered personalisation levels**:\n",
    "  - For larger customer groups, use tiered personalisations. For example, offer a higher level of personalisation to top-tier customers, i.e. those with high lifetime value or engagement history), and a more generic approach to lower-tier customers. This can help limit the costs of personalisation whilst maintaining targeted content for the most valuable customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimise campaign duration for cost efficiency**:\n",
    "  - Longer campaigns tend to cost more, but they also allow for more sustained engagement. Instead of makign the entire campaign highly personlaised, focus personalisation on key touchpoints, such as the initial email or a special offer. The remaining communication can be more standardised but still relevant, balancing cost and engagment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prioritise personalisation where it matters most**:\n",
    "  - Focus on the most impactful personalisation elements. For example, product recommendations based on past purchases or tailoring messages based on age and income may yield a higher ROI than customising every communication channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Leverage automation for scalable personalisation**:\n",
    "  - Invest in automated personalisation tools that allow for high levels of personalisation without a significant increase in cost. For example, AI-powered content recommendations or dynamic email campaigns can scale personalisation efficiently, ensuring that personalisation is automated and does not require extensive manual effort."

    "## Monitoring and optimising scoring systems\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that personalisation and cost-effectiveness are aligned and optimised, the scores must continuously be monitored and refined, and campaign strategies must be periodically re-evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few possible approaches are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Score adjustments**:\n",
    "  - Analyse if campaigns with **higher personalisation scores** are yielding the expected results in terms of engagement and conversion. If engagement drops or costs increase without a proportional increase in effectiveness, revisit the personalisation score computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strategy re-evaluation**:\n",
    "  - Continuously conduct **A/B tests** to evaluate different levels of personalisation. This will help determine the optimal level of personalisation for each customer segment.\n",
    "  - Create **feedback loops** where the insights from campaign performance inform future personalisation strategies. For example, if campaigns with moderate personalisation are performing better than highly personalised ones for certain customer segments, shift resources to maximise those mid-level personalisation strategies.\n",
    "  - Regularly review the Cost-Benefit ratio across campaigns to ensure that increasing personalisation does not disproportionately inflate costs. If the ratio begins to decline as personalisation efforts increase, it may indicate that campaigns needs to be scaled back or optimised to maintain efficiency.\n",
    "  - Compare the personalisation scores, engagement scores and Cost-Benefit ratios against **industry benchmarks** or historical performance. Continuously strive for incremental improvements based on these benchmarks, identifying underperforming campaigns and adjusting strategies to maximise the overall return on investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "By monitoring and optimising* the personalization and cost-effectiveness scores over time, businesses can ensure that their campaigns evolve to meet customer needs while maintaining a sustainable cost structure. Regular testing, adjustments, and feedback loops will ensure that the personalisation strategy remains effective and cost-efficient, ultimately driving higher engagement and maximising returns.\n"
