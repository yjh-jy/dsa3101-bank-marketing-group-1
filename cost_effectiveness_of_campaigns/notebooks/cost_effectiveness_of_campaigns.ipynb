    "## Rationale for dataset selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets \"Campaign\", \"EngagementDetail\" and \"DigitalUsage\" are directly relevant to the objective of designing a cost-benefit analysis model for assessing the impact of personalised marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Campaign\" dataset provides core business levels such as campaign type, target audience, cost of acquisition, impressions and ROI, which are needed to evaluate the efficiency and financial impact of each marketing effort. It enables us to assess whether more personalised campaigns lead to better returns on investment, or if high personalisation inflates costs disproprotionately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"EngagementDetail\" dataset is a form of measuring campaign effectiveness at the individual level, including records of whether and how customers interacted with campaigns. By linking campaign data to individual engagement outcomes, we can identify which types of campaigns perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"DigitalUsage\" dataset gives further insight into customers. It reveals user preferences for mobile and web banking, as well as their activity patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, the three datasets form a comprehensive analytical foundation to evaluate how tailoring marketing to customer behaviour influences both cost and performance, which would provide us with actionable insights."

    "1. **Reevaluate campaign strategy**: Given the negative ROI, it is essential to re-examine the campaign targeting and the channels used. Perhaps more cost-effective channels or better segmentation of the target audience could improve profitability.\n",
    "2. **Cost reduction**: The acquisition cost is quite high, so exploring ways to reduce marketing expenses could significantly improve the financial outcomes.\n",
    "3. **Consider long-term value**: While the short-term ROI is negative, it's also important to consider the customer lifetime value. If this customer segment has the potential for high future value, the initial loss may be justifiable in the long run.\n",
    "4. **Further optimisation**: Additional data analysis and A/B testing of different campaign strategies can help fine-tune the approach, reducing acquisition costs whilst maintaining or enhancing customer engagement."
