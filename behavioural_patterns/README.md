# Behavioral Patterns

## Overview

This project aims to analyze customer behaviours across different segments. By examining product usage, transaction history, and digital engagement, the analysis identifies key behavioural patterns that inform targeted marketing strategies. The insights will help tailor approaches to specific customer segments, increasing the effectiveness of marketing efforts.

## Objectives

- **Segment Analysis:**  
  Examine how customer behaviours vary across different segments.

- **Behavioural Insights:**  
  Analyze patterns in product usage, transaction history, and digital engagement.

- **Targeted Recommendations:**  
  Use the insights gained to recommend tailored marketing approaches for each customer segment.

## Expected Outcome

- **Detailed Insights:**  
  A comprehensive analysis that highlights differences in behavioural patterns among various segments.

- **Actionable Strategies:**  
  Specific recommendations for targeted marketing based on the identified patterns.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Charts and graphs that visually represent the differences in customer behaviour across segments.

## Data Description

- **Product Usage:**  
  Data capturing how customers utilize various banking products.

- **Transaction History:**  
  Records of customer transactions to identify frequency, volume, and type of activity.

- **Digital Engagement:**  
  Metrics related to customers' interaction with digital channels (e.g., mobile app usage, online banking activities).

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:**  
   Gather data from internal sources and perform necessary cleaning to ensure accuracy.

2. **Segmentation:**  
   Group customers based on demographic, behavioural, or transactional attributes.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Use statistical and visualization techniques to explore data patterns across segments.

4. **Pattern Identification:**  
   Analyze key behaviours, such as product usage trends, spending habits, and engagement levels.

5. **Recommendation Development:**  
   Translate the insights into targeted marketing recommendations for each customer segment.
