# **Key Insights**

## **Distribution of NPS categories across customer segments**

![alt text](visualizations/nps_categories_distribution.png)

**Key insights:**

- **High-value** customers have the highest proportion of promoters, indicating strong brand loyalty and satisfaction. However, some customers may have unmet expectations or issues that need addressing.

- **Budget-conscious** customers have a notable share of promoters, indicating moderate satisfaction. However, there is a slightly higher proportion of detractors among budget-conscious customers compared to at-risk/inactive customers, indicating possible financial strains or other pressures influencing their perception of the brand.

- **At-risk/inactive** customers have the lowest proportion of promoters, suggesting overall disengagement. They also have the highest proportion of passives, which may imply that they are undecided and could potentially be swayed with the right interventions, or are simply unengaged due to irrelevant product offerings or communication.

## **Financial health across customer segments**

### **Correlation matrix for financial health metrics**

![alt text](visualizations/financial_health_metrics.png)

**Key insights:**

Financial health correlations:
Higher income and savings (`log_income` and `log_balance`) strongly correlate with improved financial metrics like `balance_to_debt`, while rising debt (`log_debt`) increases `debt_to_income` ratios. The near-perfect correlation between `log_balance` and `balance_to_debt` underscores that savings are a key lever for managing debt.

Segment differentiation and business implications:

- Customers with robust income and savings typically exhibit stronger financial stability, indicating **high-value** segments that can be nurtured for upselling and cross-selling opportunities.

- Customers with lower income and savings, and often showing higher debt burdens, may represent **budget-conscious** segments that could benefit from targeted financial wellness support.

- Patterns of rising debt and financial instability may help flag **at-risk** segments, suggesting the need for re-engagement strategies to improve their financial health and overall loyalty.

### **Boxplots of 'debt-to-income' ratio and 'balance-to-debt' ratio by customer segment**

![alt text](visualizations/balance_debt_income.png)

**Key insights:**

- **High-value** customers have a generally lower and more stable debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, indicating better financial management and lower reliance on debt. The positive balance-to-debt ratio with minimal variation suggests strong financial health and likely savings.

- **Budget-conscious** customers have a generally moderate DTI ratio with some extreme outliers, suggesting potential financial strain for a subset. The higher balance-to-debt ratio indicates relatively higher balances compared to their debt. However, many outliers show negative ratios, possibly indicating account overdrafts or defaults.

- **At-risk** customers show a broad variation of DTI ratio, with a few outliers and a median similar to budget-conscious customers, suggesting inconsistent financial stability within the group. There is a significant variation in balance-to-debt ratio, with a large proportion having negative ratios, signaling potential financial distress.

### **Barplot of the proportion of customers with on-time loan payments for each segment**

**Key insights:**

- **High-value** customers exhibit the highest on-time payment rate, indicating strong financial reliability and stability. This suggests they are ideal candidates for premium offers (e.g. lower interest rates, exclusive credit lines) to reinforce loyalty.

- **Budget-conscious** customers have the lowest on-time payment rate, likely due to cash flow sensitivity. They may benefit from support measures like flexible repayment plans, automated reminders, or budgeting tools to further improve payment outcomes.

- **At-risk/inactive** customers show a moderate on-time payment rate, implying their "risk" may stem from inactivity (e.g. low engagement with other bank services) rather than payment defaults. Proactive re-engagement strategies (e.g. personalized incentives, reactivation campaigns) could improve retention.

The differences in payment behaviour across customer segments are relatively small, suggesting that overall payment reliability is not the key differentiator between segments.

### **Stacked bar chart for the percentage distribution of loan categories within each segment**

**Key insights:**

- **High-value customers** have the highest asset acquisition, business and education loans, and the lowest debt management loans, indicating a focus on investments and aligning with their financial stability.

- **Budget-conscious** customers show high debt Management loans, signaling potential financial stress or reliance on loans to manage existing obligations. Significant credit product usage suggests they may use credit to bridge cash flow gaps.

- **At-risk/inactive** customers have the highest debt management loans, indicating severe financial strain, which likely contributes to their "at-risk" status.

## **Product usage across customer segments**

### **Barplot of product usage proportions by customer segment**

**Key insights:**

- **High-value** customers show dominance in premium products with the highest adoption of investment products, credit cards, fixed deposits, and insurance. 

- **Budget-conscious** customers show moderate adoption of core products such as credit cards and insurance, but investment products lag behind high-value. There is also low fixed deposit usage, suggesting limited savings capacity.

- **At-risk/inactive** customers show low engagement with the bank products.

The chi-square tests validate that customer segments exhibit distinct financial behaviours, enabling highly targeted and data-driven marketing strategies.

### **Summary of key insights:**

- **High-value** customers lead in transaction frequency and value, indicating frequent and high-value financial activities (e.g. investments, large purchases). Combined with their net depositor status (strong cash inflow) and premium product dominance, this reflects wealth-building behaviour.

- **Budget-conscious** customers show moderate transaction frequency and value, indicating cautious spending. This aligns with their net spender status (higher cash outflow) and reliance on core products. However, they account for the largest share of the bankâ€™s overall transaction volume, making them a key segment for engagement efforts, as targeted support could significantly impact overall transaction activity and customer retention.

- **At-risk** customers exhibit the lowest transaction frequency, value, and activity, indicating low engagement rate. Targeted re-engagement efforts, such as tailored product offers or personalized outreach, may help to boost their activity and retention.

### **Summary of key insights:**

- **Budget-conscious** customers have moderate engagement but include inactive users requiring re-engagement. 

- **At-risk/inactive** customers have the lowest mobile app and web account usage, signaling limited digital interaction.
